    "# Computer Infrastructure Tasks Summary\n",
    "## Task 1\n",
    "A directory called \"data\" was created using the `mkdir` command, and two subdirectories - \"timestamps\" and \"weather\" were created inside this. The `cd` command was used to navigate into the data directory in order to make the subdirectories. \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mkdir data\n",
    "cd data\n",
    "mkdir timestamps\n",
    "mkdir weather\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 2\n",
    "Inside the timestamps directory, the `date` command was used to output the current timestamp. A file was created called `now.txt` using the `touch` command, and the `>>` operator was used to append the output of `date` to the file. This was repeated, and the contents of the file were inspected with the `more` command (this can also be accomplished with `cat`, which prints the contents of the file to the terminal)\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd timestamps\n",
    "date\n",
    "touch now.txt\n",
    "date >> now.txt\n",
    "date >> now.txt\n",
    "... etc.\n",
    "more now.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 3\n",
    "A new file called `formatted.txt` was created with the `touch` command, and the current timestamp was appended to it using the requested format (`YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS`) which was supplied as an argument to `date`. The `man` command was used to see how this argument should be structured - using `%` indicators for each timestamp component, eg. `%Y` for the year, `%m` for the month, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "touch formatted.txt\n",
    "man date\n",
    "date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\" >> formatted.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 4\n",
    "\n",
    "The above date format was used with the `touch` command in order to create a file with the formatted timestamp as part of its filename. Backticks were used rather than `>>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "touch `date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\"`.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 5\n",
    "In the `date/weather` directory, `wget` was used to retrieve the json weather content from the url: `https://prodapi.metweb.ie/observations/athenry/today`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `-O` flag was used to specify an output file - `weather.json` \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd ../weather\n",
    "wget -O weather.json https://prodapi.metweb.ie/observations/athenry/today\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "`wget` is not available by default on OSX, so the `brew` package manager was installed and (added to the `$PATH` so it could be called from a terminal session), which was then used to install `wget`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n",
    "echo >> ~/.zprofile\n",
    "echo 'eval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"' >> ~/.zprofile\n",
    "eval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "brew install wget\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 6\n",
    "Task 4 and task 5 were combined download the weather json data and save it to a timestamp formatted filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "wget -O `date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\"`.json https://prodapi.metweb.ie/observations/athenry/today\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 7\n",
    "The command from task 6 was added to a file called `weather.sh`. Its permissions were changed with `chmod` in order to make it executable (`+x`). This required the `sudo` command to run `chmod` as the superuser (root), which has the necessary permissions to make this change. A bash shebang (`#!bash`) was also added to the top of the file, so that the caller knows what language the script is to run with.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "touch weather.sh\n",
    "sudo chmod +x weather.sh\n",
